# Eliza in Go

This is an example of the Eliza chatbot coded in [Go](http://golang.org) for demonstration to students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie).
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

The code here is adapted from [smallsurething.com](https://www.smallsurething.com/implementing-the-famous-eliza-chatbot-in-python/).
The code here can be easily adapted into a library.

#### Compilation
[Go](https://golang.org) must be installed to run the code.
Then compile and run the program as follows.
```bash
$ go build eliza.go
$ ./eliza
```
